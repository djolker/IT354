          <p>Dev Eds responsive website tutorial is an action packed 40 minute video going over the creation of a professional product page for a laptop. By the end, the website created is not only responsive for different platforms, but is well styled and includes a smooth animation for nice presentation. </p>

          <p>The first thing that immediately stood out to me was how quick he was with shortcuts and IDE plugins. Sections of code that would take me a few minutes to work through he would have out in seconds.  Throughout the video, he thinks outloud so you can understand his process, and I was impressed by the amount of thinking ahead he was doing while working on the CSS of areas like the header and navlinks.  </p>

          <p>At about the 35 minute mark, he begins testing the body of the page for it's responsiveness, not just at full scale and mobile sizes, but for many different widths in between. I found this interesting, as it's not something I've made a habit of doing very often myself, but is certainly something I'll be looking at in the future.</p>

          <p>One technique I had never done before, but was intrigued to see layed out step by step, was the use of layering multiple images in the background. In this case, he uses 3 semi shaded circles and artfully places them along the background in varying positions. This adds a nice depth to the page without being distracting. </p>
