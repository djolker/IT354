         <h4>Article 4: Microservice vs Monolithic</h4>
       </div>
       <div class="col-md-7 panel">
          <p>When planning the design of an application or suite of services,
          two main design paths exist for the overall structur, Microservices
          and a Monolithic model. </p>

          <h2>Monolithic Model</h2>

          <p>The monolithic model is an architecture in which all necessary
            services and resources are built together into one large package.
          This can be a good thing, as it will be simple to maintain early on,
          and save time on redundancies for things like monitoring and security.
        However long term the Monolithic model can become difficult to scale
          and impossible to adapt to changes in technology.</p>

          <h2>Microservice Model</h2>

          <p>The Microservice model takes each branch of an application and turns
            it into it's own independent resource. This can take the form of
            breaking out the database, front end, and back end services into
            seperate projects with their own release and development cycles. This
            can be benificial in the long run, as it's much easier for each project
            to scale on its own rather than needing to grow in context of the rest
            of the project. </p>

          <p>While it may be much easier to maintain a microservice model application,
            it comes out to be much more work, as each service will need its own
            security and monitoring work dealt with.</p>

            <h2>Choosing between the two</h2>

            <p>Choosing one architecture over another in this case will come down
              to your needs and available resources. If this is an application with
              the intention of scaling greatly over time, building a Microservice
              model will be the best choice. If the project won't need to scale
              over time, and may not change much as it's added to, a Monolithic
              model may be worth building due to the amount saved in resources
              </p>
