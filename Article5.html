          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a website uses multiple fonts together, it can create what's
          called a Flash of Invisible Text. In browser, this will look like your website loading fully
          except for the text. Blocks of space will be made for the text, but nothing will render at first.
          Then after a moment, the text blocks will pop in.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These missing blocks of text are caused happens when the browsers
            detects custom fonts being called for in CSS and has to download them before rendering text.
            In 2015, this lead to a problem dealing with Mitt Romneys possible run for the presidency.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full title of the following headline is "Mitt Romney is Officially
            Not Running for President"</p>

          </br>


          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a brief moment when someone came to read this article from slate.com,
            before the bold font loaded and rendered, the headline stated that Mitt Romney would be running
            for president.  This could certainly cause some reader confusion as they may notice that the
            headline states something different than what they originally clicked on, or that the article
            didn't exactly match what they originally read the headline to be.  Furthermore, it looks
            unpolished for there to be empty gaps of space during load time where content clearly should go.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was just one example, but the same problem could apply to any number
              of other situations. Often times things like dates and adjectives will be put in different font
              styles to make them stand out more, but these critical parts of the sentence could be invisible
              on the users first impression due to those very stylings.</p>


          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zach offers a couple solutions to this problem, including defining a default font type all browsers
            have so that a placeholder text of an available font will display rather than empty space. My preferred
            solution was on the browser level though, asking that web browser developers define default fonts on
            a global level, so that this issue is resolved on all websites, not just those that implement their
            own fixes</p>
